# Day 19: Challenge Day

TimeConversion is the solution to [Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19)'s challenge. It's a SwiftUI app that performs time conversions, converting between seconds, minutes, hours and days.

The app mainly relies on approaches/APIs seen in the [first project](https://github.com/husaynhakeem/ios-playground/tree/main/100DaysOfSwiftUI/WeSplit/WeSplit), namely handling local state with `@State` and `@FocusState`, managing user input and navigation.
