# Day 16 - Day 18: Project 1

WeSplit is the first [project](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16) from 100 days of SwiftUI. It's a SwiftUI check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave.

The app showcases the basics of building iOS apps with SwiftUI: How to handle local state and bind it to user interface controls, read user input and perform navigation.
