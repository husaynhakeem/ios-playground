# Day 26 - Day 28: Project 4

BetterRest is the fourth project from 100 days of SwiftUI. It's an app that helps coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:

1. When do they want to wake up?
2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

Once the app has those three values, it feeds them into Core ML to get a result telling them when they ought to go to bed.

This project touches on various topics, including: Forms and bindings, DatePicker, Stepper, Date and DateComponents, placing buttons into the navigation bar. The project also gives a glimpse of some of the things we can build using Apple’s frameworks, with the help of Create ML and Core ML.
