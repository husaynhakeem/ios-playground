# Day 29 - Day 31: Project 5

WordScramble is the fifth project from 100 days of SwiftUI. It's a game that shows players a random eight-letter word, and asks them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

This project touches on various topics, including: rendering content in `List`, running code when the app launches with `onAppear()`, loading resources from the app `Bundle`, validating text with `UITextChecker` and stopping the app's execution with `fatalError()`.
